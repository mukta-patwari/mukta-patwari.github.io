# Welcome to my personal website!
I am a second-year MPH student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science.

I am highly interested in clinical research, particularly regarding mental health epidemiology and neuroepidemiology, as well as social determinants of health. I am currently working on my Masters' thesis, which is a data analysis project focused on mothers' return to school and the effect on global physical and mental health.

My hobbies include running, reading, knitting, and baking. I'm hoping to run my first race at the end of 2025!
